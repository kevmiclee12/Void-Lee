You feel few of the same feelings, despite the bodily similarity. And yet, you just love dogs, and you know that if you follow certain procedures, a mean-seeming dog may flip onto its back.^^The dog submits to your touch, and leans against you. You find a collar with a locket wrapped around its neck. The locket is glowing faintly with a sigul of a crescent moon. The dog does not react to you touching the locket, and you think to open it. Inside the locket is a dried bit of plant matter that smells of vanilla, and a taped lock of hair.^^As you hold these items, they dissolve in your palm, and you feel an energy fill you with intention.`
