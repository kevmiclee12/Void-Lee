<!-- I saw the Moondog again today
Under the empty playground slide
in the park. An empty locket hangs around their neck.
They contemplate the slide and my hide
I work up the guts to say,
“You’re not a dog now, what the heck!”
Moondog says, “You made me this way,
and it’s been so long since I’ve been just one thing.
Don’t you think you ought to take responsibility?”
I thought about it, and with my gait, I rose
to the top of the slide’s deck.
I purse my lips, open my chest, and sing.
The Moon-former-dog pipes up, “You’ve got real ability!
Though, please, could you show me how to be human?”
I looked the Moondog in the eyes. Then I took them to a museum.
But they wouldn’t let the Moondog in
Something about *parts flapping in the wind*
So I took the Moondog to a Lost and Found
full of clothes they could fit into.
Then I brought the Moondog to a swamp,
the wastewater treatment plant,
the grocery store,
a shelter, a job placement agency.
The Moondog said, “I don’t want to be human if I have to be poor,
to stop my howling before I get too loud,
and keep things I find inside a door,
inside a box within a box, in a box.
I’m out.”
I never saw the Moondog again
Until I went to buy some used CDs 
I heard the Moondog at the counter—I stop, I freeze.
There they were, winking back at me, 
bearded, beastly, and barking up the tree
—of music—it was music to my ease. -->
