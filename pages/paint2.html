The closest one towers over you. It is covered in dirt and seaweed, and it drips water.^^As you look out along the coast, there are many such beasts. They recede past the curve of the coast, shrouded in mist and seagulls.^^You admire the immense mass of your nearest beast. Like a child, you stare in unselfconscious awe of the thing. For you it is colored by no relatable experience. Lost in awe, you forget that you yourself are on the same beach.`
