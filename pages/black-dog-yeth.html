<!-- You look down, see bared canines, and hear a low growl rumble.
You hesitate, off-balance,
The mutt changes, now looking cruel with human in its face.
Poisonous, like an underground cache of anthrax
Your hands shake, and liquid light spills from your chalice.
The dirt slurps it up, leaving no trace.
The hackles of the hound relax.
It smells your anxiety, growing like a puddle of piss.
It licks its lips, imagining your taste.
You flee, releasing the tension between the two of you, the Yeth Hound follows your tracks,
loping, at ease, it feeds:
On your fears, your feelings, your horror.
It barks in a human way, evil, filled with glee
at the chase, sapping your strength.
You think, as your heartbeat increases, you think
your years of feeling brave and free—
tears, dilemmas, and puzzles, richer and poorer.
You think this kind of creature, from fear, can drink.
Even if your expression, it can’t see.
You shall try a gambit, or it may beat yee.
You must latch onto a solid wavelength
To stabalize, secure my base
You release a pocket full of tacks
And kick out at the Yeth Hound with malice
You open my eyes back up to see lights, and people filming me
One shouts, “dog kicker!” and another throws a bottle at you.
You turn toward the beast, only to watch it flee, its hindquarters furry in the breeze
