<!-- Try to pick up pine needles while running.
 Check how many pine needles they have picked up.
 if more than 2, they start to sink, and the trees all hit them, breaking all their bones. The Leakrave/Leakparty forms around their broken body, and someone pours dream beer in their mouth.
 if less than 2, they are able to use the pine needles like a trampoline and vault up over the canopy. A bird grabs them and they see the entire countryside, a rocket with arms grabs the bird and takes both of you into space, then back into the stratosphere, then the rocket aims for the forest floor, creating a huge explosion, and the player and bird are all exploded and charred, but then their body combines with the bird, and a Leak Party is formed on the footprint of the blast-->
