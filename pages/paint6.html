 1. You draw in detail in the next panel a 1/2/3/4 character atop the windsail beest. With big eyes, and cartoonish swagger, you draw them looking around the back.
 2. The figure finds a heart-shaped box on the back. You draw a close-up of it, it looks like a tiny treasure chest that you draw with a pink-marker aura so that it seems to be glowing.
 3. You draw your character opening up the box, and finding controls inside: a joystick, and three buttons of different colors.
 4. Choices: A. Draw them pushing the joystick forward, angling toward another beest, B. Draw them pressing the green button, C. Draw them destroying the box
