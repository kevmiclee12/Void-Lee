You feel riveted to the spot, unable to look away.^^You recall the words of your sister the last time she read your fortune using those weird blocks and strings, "You must be careful! There is a Red Dog. And, there is a Black Dog." But...this is both? You start acting careful.^^As the Redblack dog approaches, you notice with rising nausea that it has a humanlike face but with dog flesh, and full dark eyes. The dog snarls, and it sounds like a hungry snarl. As it closes the distance to you, you see that its hair is caught in snarls too. Ungroomed...^^The human-faced dog circles you, growling, barking, with human-like lips that reveal its strong jaw and saliva-wet teeth. The redblack dog lunges at your ankles, its teeth snapping around your heels as you leap back.`
