<!-- Park listen 3: Your reverie is interrupted when you overhear a group that is walking together, led by an instructor.
 The instructor says, "Now, spread out across the park, and follow your ears. Remember I told you, the ancient Elypgians thought of the feet as ears, and the ears as the seat of consciousness. So be gentle on those dogs."
 You see the group span out into the field. One stops to listen to a tree strump. One stops to listen to a pipe sticking out of the ground, spewing steam. The instructor walks slowly toward you, and seems to walk slower and slower as they approach you. It becomes kind of strange, the person seems to want to talk to you, but is a little too far away. Nevertheless, (he?) tries making eye contact with you the entire time.
 Choices:
 A. Walk toward the instructor.
 B. Walk towards the stump.
 C. Walk toward the pipe.
 A1. You walk up to the instructor, who does not stop moving, but seems to be moving extremely slowly.
 B1. You walk up to the stump. You see flies buzzing all around it, landing in pools of rainbow-looking liquid that cover a good portion of the stump's surface. The sound of the buzzing doesn't bother you much. You tilt your head toward the stump like the other student did, and as you get closer, the buzzing seems to make a song in the gentle breeze. You get so close that you notice that the flies are vomiting up the liquid...and then drinking it back up. Are they eating the stump??
 C1. You walk up to the pipe. It makes a soft whooshing sound. The steam gets into your nostrils. It has no odor, but feels warm and damp, and tickles you. 
 A2. "Hi, I'm Biff, he/they. I'm leading a class right now, but I love walk-ins. Want to join us?" Biff makes a goofy smile, and keeps on slowly pantomiming a walk.
 B2 and C2. A person walks up to you, female-presenting, and listens with you, wrinkling her nose, her eyes sparkle with amusement. "Hi I'm Awah, she/they. What's your name?"
A3. You can't help but smile at Biff, who is really hamming it up. You agree. "Great! We're all walking in this field as silently as possible, listening to the world like its a symphony.^^The 
BC3. [[ENTER NAME OF CHARACTER]]
 BC4. "Nice to meet you, [[name]]!" whispers Awah. This is a Deep Listening class. The instructor Biff is great. We are supposed to walk around the field and listen to anything we can. Want to join us? Biff said we should invite anyone we meet."
