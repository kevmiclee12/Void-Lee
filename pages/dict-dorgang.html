Always cleverness is Dorgang's jam. And he also knows a lot about anything weird, powerful or mystical. He's always on his enemies' asses, making sure they do not commit evil against large swatches of other people. Dorgang is not exactly what one might call 'chill' or 'bussin'. That being said, you REALLY want Dorgang on your team, no matter what.^^Dorgang is a Gandalf-like parody character made up by someone at Wendall Carefare's Leaktable. If a comparative reference to Dorgang led you here, just know that Dorgang can be used as a comparative character-reference to the chracter that is being compared to Dorgang. They are Dorgang-like.
