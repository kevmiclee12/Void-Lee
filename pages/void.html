There are arms and legs with no use, and in the little bags of water that make us up there is  information with no use. There are third eyes that do not see. ^^Death and the void are not the same. They are close, but not the same. If you are dead, you are somewhere. The dead once stalked this Earf. The dead live on in others' minds. Absense is more than the void. The void is nothing, nowhere.^^There is no sad in the Void. Is the Void alone?`,
