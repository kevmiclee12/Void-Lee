<!-- You wished, but there aren't. But this park is rather pretty...and there's a huge snowpile that looks pretty cool to play on...and a neighborhood beyond, maybe it would be fun to find someone to talk to. -->
 <!-- Add Choice: Play on the Snowpile -->
  <!-- Play on the Snowpile PG: You approach the snowpile, and as you do, you hear the sounds of sport and athleticism sprouting from the summit. As you look closer, you note that there are figures at the top of the snow pile, and it sounds sporting! As you climb the snowpile, the figures seem to grow in size, and the ground recedes. As you near the summit, you are sweating and breathing vigorously. Ah! What a nice hike! Before you, upon flat stretch of snowy grass, there's a soccer match, it looks friendly and safe, yet competitive, and there are a variety of different people of all races and genders playing.
   Choice: Call out to ask if you can join the match 
   Choice: Talk to a kid playing marbles (NPC that has one line): Marbles are the same shape as the Earf!
   CHoice: Talk to a couple of kids. One is pulling the other in a sled. "Pull faster! No! Faster, cur!"
   Choice: Watch for a minute, then back out, and head back to the park-->
   <!-- Join the Match: The players beckon you in, and ask you to play defense. You stand in front of the goal post on the left, following the movement of the ball.^^It sails up into the sky, and is trapped by a black woman wearing a circular neck scarf. She is wearing goggles, her hair tight in a bun.  She has on a blue pinnie. Your opponent. Her movements are agile as she feints passed your teammate. She runs toward you, dribbling. 
    MatchChoice: Run up to her, and attempt to steal the ball by making a smart lunge.
    MatchChoice2: Approach, but keep a distance, put yourself between her and the goal.
    MatchChoice3:  Run back toward the goal, keeping an eye over your shoulder.-->
